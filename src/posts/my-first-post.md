### Map Journal Project
funny little web project to test GIS rendering. I spent way to long on these little post-it cards. Try hovering over them!

 I'm happy with this start! You can write these blog posts in little markdown files and it generates the layout auto-magically.

I need to work on the overlapping a bit, and the image extends off it's post-it. Needs a little more fine-tuning...

another image to test

so the map works, that's just the default styling that maplibre uses, but I should be able to create my own style however I like.

So next I want to include geo-markers with camera animations, then you could mark locations and it would fly to the spot.

right now I only tested a simple spin animation

The idea would be when you hover over these postcards, you could tie it to locations! so you could leave a little cookie trail 

okay bed time... I'm sleepy
